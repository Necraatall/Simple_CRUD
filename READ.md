First version works successfully - needed files and folders:
main.py
>templates
    index.html
Second version works good tooo - simple function not tested much
version2.py
>templates
    new.html
    show_all.html



need to run in terminal:
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy

flask --app main run

or better in vscode with F5 on name of the files - main.py or version2.py
